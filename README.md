## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basit3000/ChatGPT-service.git
cd ChatGPT-service
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables. The file might include configurations such as API keys and database settings. Hereâ€™s a sample .env file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

Replace your_openai_api_key and your_database_url with your actual values.

## Usage

### 1. Run the FastAPI Server

To start the FastAPI server, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This will start the server in development mode. For production use, consider configuring Uvicorn with a production-ready setup.

## Troubleshooting

Common Issues

    Error: ModuleNotFoundError

    Make sure that all dependencies are installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt within the activated virtual environment.

    Error: InvalidRequestError

    This error usually indicates an issue with the API request to OpenAI. Check your API key and ensure that you have the correct permissions.

    Error: RateLimitError

    You may have exceeded your API quota. Check your OpenAI account for details on usage and quotas.

    Error: No module named 'openai'

    Verify that openai is listed in requirements.txt and that it is installed in your virtual environment. You can install it manually with pip install openai.

    Error: Cannot import name 'RateLimitError' from 'openai'

    Ensure you are using a compatible version of the OpenAI library. Update the library with pip install --upgrade openai.
